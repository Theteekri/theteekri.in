To help navigate these challenges and opportunities, we asked 22 SEO experts to share their insights, predictions, and actionable strategies that businesses can implement to stay ahead in the ever-changing digital space. Here are their key recommendations to future-proof your SEO efforts:
1. Focus On The Fundamentals And Ensure Your SEO Foundation Is Strong Enough To Compete In A More Complex And Competitive Search Landscape
The basics of SEO, like keyword research, site speed, mobile-friendliness, and proper indexing, remain as crucial as ever. 
2. Focus More On UX To Ensure Websites Provide Exceptional User Experience That Meets Both Search Engine Requirements And User Expectations For Engagement And Satisfaction
User experience (UX) will be a core ranking factor. Websites that prioritize intuitive navigation, page load speed, and seamless interactions will see better engagement and visibility. 
3. Start Considering Awareness And Upper Funnel Metrics As Essential Components For Measuring SEO Success Across Every Stage Of The Customer Journey, Not Just Conversions
SEO isn’t just about conversions anymore. Brands should measure upper-funnel metrics, such as brand awareness and visibility, to capture potential customers at every stage of their journey. 
4. Start With Video-First Content To Capitalize On The Growing Demand For Video Across Search Engines, Social Media, And Platforms That Prioritize Visual Storytelling
Video content is poised to dominate SERPs. Short-form videos, tutorials, and explainers will rank higher, driving significant engagement and organic reach. 
5. Diversify Where Your Community Might Be Spending Time Online To Adapt To Changing User Behavior And Identify Emerging Platforms Where Your Audience Is Actively Engaged
Communities are shifting. Brands must identify where their target audience engages online—whether it’s Reddit, Discord, TikTok, or niche forums—and optimize their presence accordingly. 
6. Organize And Structure The Content Hierarchy To Help Search Engines And Users Easily Understand Your Content’s Intent, Relevance, And Value While Improving Discoverability
Clear content structure is critical for SEO success. Experts predict that well-organized content hierarchies, utilizing headings, subheadings, and internal linking, will remain key for crawling and indexing. Structured content ensures both users and search engines quickly understand the value and relevance of your content.
7. Build Author Authority And Explore Alternative Traffic Sources To Position Trusted Experts And Diversify Your Online Reach Beyond Traditional Search Platforms
Establishing author authority will boost trust and rankings. Additionally, brands should explore alternative platforms, such as newsletters, social media, and other non-search traffic sources. 
8. Create More Q&A Content To Be Present In LLMs And AI Tools That Prioritize Answering User Queries With Relevant And Clear Information
Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on Q&A content. Brands that address specific user queries will have better chances of being referenced in AI-powered search tools. 
9. Index Licensing Will Become Increasingly Important As Brands Explore Opportunities To Partner With Search Engines And AI Platforms To Monetize Content Inclusion
Experts predict a rise in index licensing, where brands negotiate the inclusion of their proprietary content into search engines or AI tools. 
10. Build Relationships With Other Well-Ranking Sites In Relevant Industries To Improve Credibility, Enhance Link Profiles, And Drive Collaborative SEO Success
Collaborating with authoritative sites in similar niches will help improve credibility, drive backlinks, and elevate search rankings. Building strong relationships across well-ranking sites creates opportunities for long-term SEO growth and niche authority.
